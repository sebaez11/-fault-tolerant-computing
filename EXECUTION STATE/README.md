**Game description:** The provided code is an implementation of a "Triqui" (Tic-Tac-Toe) game using Python's Tkinter library. It utilizes checkpointing to save and load game states, and features a graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction. The code handles game logic, player moves, and displays game outcomes.

## **Techniques specifications.**

Checkpointing is a technique that involves taking periodic snapshots of an executing application's state. These snapshots are used to restore the application in case of failures, thereby enhancing the reliability and availability of critical computer systems. It is crucial for minimizing downtime, reducing data loss, and keeping systems operational during maintenance.

**Windows command execution:** py ./main.py
**Linux command execution:** python3 ./main.py

### **Used libraries.**

 - Tkinter for the GUI.
 - pickle for data serialization.
 - os for file operations.
