# Fault Tolerant Computing

Fault-tolerant computing is a field of computer science and engineering focused on designing and implementing systems and software that can continue functioning correctly even in the presence of hardware failures, software errors, or unexpected events. The primary goal of fault-tolerant computing is to ensure system reliability and availability, reducing the impact of faults or failures on the overall system's performance.
